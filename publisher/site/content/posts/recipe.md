Introduction

Growing up in rural Sweden, lazy Sunday mornings were a special time for my family. It was a time when we could sleep in and enjoy a leisurely breakfast together. And no lazy Sunday morning breakfast would be complete without a stack of fluffy, mouthwatering pancakes.



Anecdote

I remember one lazy Sunday morning when I was a young boy, my grandmother would wake up early and start preparing the pancake batter. As we all stumbled downstairs into the kitchen, the smell of butter melting in the pan filled the air. My grandmother would stand at the stove, flipping pancake after pancake, while my siblings and I eagerly waited to devour them. It was a magical moment that I will always cherish.
