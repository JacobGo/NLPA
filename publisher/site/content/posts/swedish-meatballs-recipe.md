# The Exquisite Swedish Meatballs

Ah, meatballs. Is there anything more comforting than a plate of juicy, tender meatballs smothered in a rich, creamy sauce? I think not. And when it comes to meatballs, the Swedish know what they're doing. 

Growing up in Sweden, my grandma used to make the most exquisite Swedish meatballs. Every time we visited her, the smell of these meatballs wafting through the house would bring a smile to our faces. It was like a warm hug in the form of food.

Today, I want to share with you my grandma's recipe for Swedish meatballs. It's a treasure handed down through the generations, and I'm excited to pass it on to you. This recipe is simple, using everyday ingredients that you probably already have in your pantry, but the result is a dish that will transport you to Sweden with each bite.

So let's gather our ingredients and get cooking!

## Ingredients:

- 500g ground beef
- 250g ground pork
- 1/2 cup breadcrumbs
- 1/4 cup milk
- 1/2 onion, finely chopped
- 1 clove garlic, minced
- 1/4 teaspoon ground allspice
- 1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
- Salt and pepper, to taste
- 2 tablespoons butter
- 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
- 2 cups beef broth
- 1/2 cup heavy cream


## Instructions:

1. In a large bowl, combine the ground beef, ground pork, breadcrumbs, milk, onion, garlic, allspice, nutmeg, salt, and pepper. Mix well until all the ingredients are evenly incorporated. Shape the mixture into small meatballs, about the size of a ping pong ball.

2. In a large skillet, melt the butter over medium heat. Add the meatballs and cook until browned on all sides, about 5 minutes. Remove the meatballs from the skillet and set aside.

3. In the same skillet, sprinkle the flour over the remaining butter and cook for 1 minute, stirring constantly. Gradually whisk in the beef broth, making sure to scrape up any browned bits from the bottom of the skillet. Bring the mixture to a simmer and cook until thickened, about 5 minutes.

4. Stir in the heavy cream and return the meatballs to the skillet. Reduce the heat to low and simmer for an additional 10 minutes, or until the meatballs are cooked through and the sauce has thickened.

5. Serve the Swedish meatballs hot, garnished with parsley, alongside mashed potatoes or lingonberry jam for a truly authentic Swedish meal.

Enjoy!
